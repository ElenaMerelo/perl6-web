WebRequest
-----------

WebRequest is the spiritual successor to CGI.pm on Perl 5.
It supports standard CGI, SCGI (recommended) and mod-perl6.
Currently only supports GET and non-multipart POST.

I am planning on adding multi-part POST including file uploads,
and some optional magic parameters similar to the ones in PHP.

Status: Stable, but with planned new features as above.

Requirements:

 - Rakudo Perl 6
   http://rakudo.org/

 - Hash::Has
   http://github.com/supernovus/hash-has

Optional (but recommended):

  - SCGI
    http://github.com/supernovus/SCGI

Note:

  I would not recommend using standard CGI with Perl 6. It's horridly slow,
  and the current version of Rakudo has some bugs when using %*ENV like a Hash.
  The SCGI library is highly recommended, and is what WebRequest has been
  tested with.

Example:

  use SCGI;
  use WebRequest;

  my $scgi = SCGI.new( :port(8118) );

  my $handler = sub (%env) {
    my $request = WebRequest.new(:%env);
    my $return = "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
    $return ~= "Request parameters:\n";
    $return ~= $request.params.fmt('%s: %s', "\n");
    my $name = $request.get('name');
    if $name {
      $return ~= "Hello $name";
    }
    return $return;
  }

  $scgi.handle: $handler;

  ## End of script.

See the ww6 project for a more comprehensive example of the combination of
SCGI and WebRequest. http://github.com/supernovus/ww6
